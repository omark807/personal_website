    <p>Technology that's accessible to anyone and everyone: for as long as I can remember, achieving this has been my passion. As someone with a retinal disorder (Stargardt's disease), I interact with technology using a variety of accessibility features,
        and without these features, it would be extremely challenging for me to carry out my day-to-day tasks. My goal is to create technology that is accessible to every one, regardless of disability and other underlying conditions they may have.
