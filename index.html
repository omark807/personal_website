<p>Technology that's accessible to anyone and everyone: for as long as I can remember, achieving this has been my passion. 
    As someone with a retinal disorder (Stargardt's disease), I interact with technology using a variety of accessibility features, and
    without these features, it would be extremely challenging for me to carry out my day-to-day tasks. My goal is to create technology that 
is accessible to every one, regardless of disability and other underlying conditions they may have. </p>
