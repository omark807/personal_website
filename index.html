    <p class="intro">
        Hi there! I'm Omar (he/him/his) and I am a Computer Science + Crop Sciences major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a minor in Linguistics. But...it definitely wasn't always that way.
        <br>
        <br> To me, it's way too cmmon that we create technology that's harder to use than it should be, making it feel as though we're working for technology, and not the other way around. Software engineers can be too fixated on the code they write
        and forget who they're writing it for, and that's the problem I hope to make a dent in with my work. As someone who relies on accessibility features in the tech I use everyday, I need my tech to really adhere to the unique way I need to work.
        This is a sentiment echeod by countless people with didabilities and other limitations, and to me, this just isn't right.
        <br>
        <br> I hope to not only craft memorable user experiences, but also make the lives of those that use my work easier, because that's how tech should work: advancing the way you work, and by extension, the world.
